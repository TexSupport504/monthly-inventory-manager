# Monthly Inventory Manager - Executive Summary
**Professional Event-Driven Inventory Optimization System**

---

## 🎯 **BUSINESS PROBLEM SOLVED**

**Challenge:** Event teams struggle with inventory planning because they don't know:
- How much inventory to stock for upcoming events
- When to position inventory (setup vs. event vs. teardown phases)
- How event size and type impact actual demand

**Solution:** Event-aware inventory forecasting using historical attendance data and event lifecycle analysis.

## 🔮 **HOW IT WORKS: Event-Driven Forecasting**

### **1. Event Lifecycle Intelligence**
```
In-Date ──► Start Date ──► End Date ──► Out-Date
  ↓            ↓             ↓           ↓
Setup      Live Event    Wind-down   Teardown
Phase       Demand        Phase       Phase
```

**Your team gets inventory recommendations for each phase:**
- **Pre-Event (In-Date):** Setup materials, promotional items
- **Live Event (Start-End):** Peak demand based on attendance
- **Post-Event (Out-Date):** Cleanup supplies, leftover management

### **2. Attendance-Based Demand Modeling**
- **Historical Analysis:** Uses actual attendance from 3,734+ previous events
- **Similar Event Matching:** Finds comparable events by type, venue, size
- **Conversion Calculations:** Attendees → actual inventory consumption
- **Safety Stock:** Prevents stockouts with configurable service levels

### **3. Real-World Example**
```
Event: Tech Conference 2025
├── Similar Past Events: 5 conferences, avg 480 attendees
├── Conversion Rate: 15% of attendees buy promotional items
├── Attach Rate: 1.2 items per transaction
├── Forecast Demand: 500 × 0.15 × 1.2 = 90 promotional items
└── Safety Stock (95% service level): +18 items = 108 total needed
```
