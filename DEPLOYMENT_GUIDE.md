## 🔧 Technical Architecture

### Data Flow Architecture
```
Event Calendar → Demand Forecast → Safety Stock → Buy Plan → Executive Reports
     ↓              ↓                   ↓            ↓
Inventory Counts → Current Stock → Available DoS → Priority Ranking
     ↓
Forms Intake → Validation → Canonical Table → KPI Dashboard
Manual Entry → Deduplication → Exception Handling → Alerts
```

### Integration Points
1. **Microsoft Forms** → Power Automate → Excel (Real-time)
2. **Manual Entry** → Excel Validation → Canonical Table (Batch)  
3. **Power Query** → Data Refresh → KPI Updates (Scheduled)
4. **Python Controller** → CSV Export → Reporting Pack (On-demand)

### Security & Governance
- Forms restricted to organization users
- Excel workbook on SharePoint with appropriate permissions
- Audit trail for all count submissions
- Exception logging with resolution tracking

## 🏆 Success Metrics & ROI

### Expected Benefits
- **50% reduction** in count transcription time
- **90% improvement** in data accuracy
- **30% better** inventory turns through optimized DoS
- **$100K+ annual savings** from reduced stockouts and overstock

### Business Impact Tracking
```python
# Monthly ROI calculation
time_saved_hours = count_volume * 0.5  # 50% time reduction
cost_per_hour = 25  # Loaded employee cost
monthly_savings = time_saved_hours * cost_per_hour

accuracy_improvement = 0.90  # 90% fewer errors
error_cost_avoided = error_count_baseline * error_cost_avg * accuracy_improvement

total_monthly_roi = monthly_savings + error_cost_avoided
```
